== Usage

Add the following to your http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen's] `project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
[net.tbt-post/sentry-tiny "0.1.14"]
----

and just use it to catch your exception:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[sentry-tiny.core :as stc])

(def dsn "http://<digest>@<sentry>/<id>")

(defn catch [ns _ _ ^Throwable e]
  (-> dsn
      stc/parse-dsn
      (stc/capture (stc/e->evi [(str ns)] e))))
----

or to just send a message

[source,clojure]
----
(defn message [msg]
  (-> dsn
      stc/parse-dsn
      (stc/capture
        (stc/e->evi [(str *ns*)]
                    (RuntimeException. msg))
        "warning")))
----

You may eventually use it as a replacement inside of your web app router.
